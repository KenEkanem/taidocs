Our E-Signatures solution provides a secure, legally binding, and highly verifiable method for signing electronic documents. By directly linking signatures to a user's National Identification Number (NIN), we ensure authenticity, non-repudiation, and compliance with national digital signature regulations.

---

### Overview and Features

- **Legal Validity**: Our e-signatures meet the legal requirements for binding agreements, recognized under Nigerian law and international standards.
- **NIN-Linked Verification**: Each signature is securely tied to the signatory's unique National Identification Number, providing an unparalleled level of identity verification.
- **Non-Repudiation**: The strong link to a verified NIN makes it virtually impossible for a signatory to falsely deny having signed a document.
- **Document Integrity**: Ensures that documents remain untampered after signing, with robust cryptographic hashing to detect any alterations.
- **Ease of Use**: A seamless and intuitive signing experience for both individuals and businesses, integrating directly into digital workflows.
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logs of the signing process, including timestamps, IP addresses, and authentication methods, for irrefutable proof.

### How E-Signatures Work

The process of applying and verifying a NIN-based e-signature is designed for security and simplicity.

<Accordion title="E-Signature Process">
  ### 1. Document Preparation

  The sender uploads a document (e.g., PDF) to our platform and specifies the signature fields and signatories.

  ### 2. Identity Authentication

  Each signatory receives a request to sign. They authenticate their identity using their NINProfile, which may involve multi-factor authentication (MFA) and biometrics.

  ### 3. NIN-Linked Signing

  Upon successful authentication, the signature is cryptographically linked to the signatory's verified NIN and applied to the document.

  ### 4. Document Hashing and Timestamping

  A unique cryptographic hash of the document is generated, and a timestamp is embedded, locking the document's state at the time of signing.

  ### 5. Secure Storage and Distribution

  The signed document, along with its comprehensive audit trail, is securely stored and can be distributed to all parties.

### Use Cases

- **Contracts and Agreements**: Legally sign business contracts, service agreements, and partnership documents.
- **HR Documents**: Securely sign employment contracts, policy acknowledgments, and onboarding forms.
- **Financial Transactions**: Authorize financial agreements, loan documents, and account openings.
- **Legal Documents**: Execute affidavits, consent forms, and other legal instruments.

### Common Issues and Troubleshooting

<Warning>
  If you encounter issues, please check our [FAQ](/faq) and [Glossary](/glossary) for quick answers. If the problem persists, contact our support team.
</Warning>

- **Signature Invalidity**: Ensure the signatory's NIN is valid and their NINProfile is active.
- **Document Corruption**: If a document appears altered after signing, the integrity check will fail. Do not proceed with corrupted documents.
- **Authentication Failures**: Verify the signatory is using the correct NINProfile credentials and MFA.
- **Integration Problems**: Check API parameters and ensure proper document formatting for automated signing workflows.
