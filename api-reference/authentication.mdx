All API requests must be authenticated. We use Bearer Token authentication. You will receive an API key upon account creation 
that must be included in the `Authorization` header of your requests.

```bash
'Authorization': 'Bearer <team_token>'
```

<Warning>
  **Important**: Keep your API key secure and do not expose it in client-side code.
