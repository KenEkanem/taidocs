Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.

Now let's break it down:

- **Open Source:** Python's source code is freely available for anyone to inspect, modify, and distribute.
- **Interpreted:** Python code is executed line by line by an interpreter, rather than being compiled into machine code before execution. This allows for easier debugging and more flexibility.
- **Object-oriented:** Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP), a programming paradigm that uses objects – data structures consisting of data fields and methods – to design and organize code.
- **High-level:** Python is considered a high-level programming language, meaning it abstracts away low-level details like memory management and CPU instructions, making it easier for programmers to write and understand code.
- **Dynamic Semantics:** Python has dynamic semantics, meaning that variables do not need to be declared with their data types before they are used, and the type of a variable can change during execution.

As of February 2024, Python remains the most popular programming language according to the
