  ### 1. Employee Registration (Optional but Recommended)

  Employees can register and create their profiles, linking their NIN for verifiable identity. This enables them to view their own reference history.

  ### 2. Employer Contributions

  Authorized employers contribute verified data regarding employee conduct, performance, and exits. All contributions are subject to a verification process.

  ### 3. Data Verification

  All submitted data is cross-referenced and verified where possible, leveraging NIN-based authentication to ensure accuracy and prevent false reporting.

  ### 4. Accessing References

  Prospective employers, with appropriate consent from the candidate, can access a candidate's verified reference history.

  ### 5. Impact on Hiring

  This comprehensive history allows employers to make more informed hiring decisions, reducing risks associated with unknown past conduct.
