Welcome to the Trust and Identity Solutions API Reference. Our APIs allow you to seamlessly integrate our secure identity verification, compliance, and e-signature functionalities directly into your applications.

### Rate Limits

To ensure fair usage and system stability, our APIs are subject to rate limits. Exceeding these limits may result in `429 Too Many Requests` errors. Please refer to specific endpoint documentation for detailed rate limit information.

### Error Handling

Our API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

- `2xx` - Success  
- `4xx` - Client error (e.g., bad request, unauthorized)  
- `5xx` - Server error

Error responses typically include a JSON payload with an `error` message and a `code` for easier debugging.

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid NIN provided",
  "code": "NIN_INVALID"
}
````
